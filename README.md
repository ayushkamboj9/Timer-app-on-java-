The Timer App is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Java using Swing components. Here's a description of its features and functionality:

1.Timer Display: The main feature of the app is a large display area that shows the countdown timer in HH:MM:SS format.
2.Input Fields: Users can input the desired countdown time by entering the number of hours, minutes, and seconds into separate text fields provided.
Control Buttons:
3.Start Button: Initiates the countdown timer based on the input provided. Once started, the timer counts down in real-time.
4.Pause Button: Pauses the countdown timer. Clicking it again resumes the countdown from where it left off.
5.Reset Button: Stops the countdown timer and resets it to 00:00:00. This button can be used to restart the timer with a new input.
6.Visual Feedback: The app provides visual feedback through color-coded buttons and text to indicate the current state of the timer (running, paused, or stopped).
7.Error Handling: The app performs input validation to ensure that users enter valid numerical values for hours, minutes, and seconds.
8.Countdown Logic: The countdown timer logic calculates the remaining time based on the user input and updates the display every second until the countdown reaches zero.
9. User Interaction: Users can interact with the app through mouse clicks on the control buttons and by entering input into the text fields.


Overall, the Timer App provides a user-friendly interface for setting and tracking countdown timers, making it useful for various timing tasks such as cooking, workouts, and productivity management.
